        <p><strong>“ Lucky Cash “</strong> - For every $50 that you spend, you will have a chance to win cash prizes. (The $50 Lucky Cash Ticket Qualification Amounts excludes: Taxes, Shipping and any (EHF) Environmental Handling Fees). Lucky Casg Winners will receive their winnings as well as extra Cash Bonuses if you share that you have won on your Facebook Account. We will make payments to: Credit Card/Debit Card Accounts or PayPal Accounts. Winning “Lucky Cash Sweepstakes" automatically enters Winners into our "Hookbag Commission Referral Program Club." </p><br>

        <p><strong>“ Hookbag Commission Referral Program”</strong> - How our program works. We ask that you share your information about your experience that you had with Hookbag on your Facebook Account. You will be given a Unique ID Link that you can share with your friends, co-workers and family. When they come to Hookbag, sign up and purchase an item(s) from Hookbag, and use the ID Link that you have provided them then you will make a commission on that sale. When your friends, co-workers or family sign up they will also get their own Unique ID Link to pass on to new referrals.(Important: Hookbag uses these ID Links to pay members their Direct Commissions and Commission Bonuses) The more people that sign up, the more money you will make, from any purchase/s that they make. There is no limit to how much you can earn or how many people are Linked to you or with you.</p>
        <p><strong> Direct Sales: </strong> A 3% Direct Sales Commission is automatically given to the closest Introducer/Upline of the person making the purchase </p>
			<p><strong>Indirect Sales:</strong>Indirect Commission is given to every Upline Member that is indirectly involved in the referral process that helped to creat a purhase on Hookbag.  Commission Amounts will vary due to the number of people involved that eventually created a Purchase with Hookbag. These Commissions and Bonuses also apply to future purchases. Note: You must be an Active CRP Member to particpate and collect earnings. </p>
