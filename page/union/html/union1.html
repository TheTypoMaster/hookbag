						<h3>Attachment: Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities Rules</h3>
						<p><strong>1. Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities User Participation Qualifications</strong><br>
						Users who are participating in Hookbag Sweepstakes Activities will gain Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities participation qualifications after they win in the Sweepstakes Activities.<br>
						Newly registered users will gain Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities Participation Qualifications if they register on Hookbag official website from other Commission Referral Program Member’s sharing link or by filling in Commission Referral Program Member's user name during the initial registration process, and also cumulatively spending CAD 100 on Hookbag after their registration.<br>
						Registered users will gain Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities Participation Qualifications if they log into Hookbag’s official website from other Commission Referral Program Member's sharing link, and also cumulatively spending CAD 100.<br>
						Users who gain Hookbag Commission Referral Program Activities Participation Qualifications for the first time need to fill in your Commission Referral Program Member nickname and agree with Hookbag’s Commission Referral Program Activities Agreement so as to become Commission Referral Program Members.</p>
						<p><strong>2. Commission Referral Program Membership Validity</strong><br>
						A. New entrants into the Commission Referral Program Activities may enjoy one-year Commission Referral Program Membership.<br>
						B. How to extend your Commission Referral Program Membership: purchase CAD 100 or more worth of product through Hookbag within the validity of Commission Referral Program Membership, and the validity will extend for 1 year, calculated by your last purchase advance payment through our online shopping website.<br>
						C. Commission Referral Program Membership expiration: if there is no extension after the expiration date, Hookbag will cancel your Commission Referral Program Membership and release the relationship between you and your referrals. Your referrals percentages will adjust towards your introducer. This new introduction relationship will not be the same. It will be as if you were starting as a New Commission Referral Program Member, even after you resume your Commission Referral Program Membership. Your lost referrals cannot be recovered, while your introducer remains the same. The sharing link issued within the validity period of Commission Referral Program Membership is broken and regarded as an ordinary link.<br>
						D. Resume Commission Referral Program Membership: Purchase CAD 100 or more worth of product from Hookbag after your Commission Referral Program Membership is canceled, and you will resume your Commission Referral Program Membership. Your lost referrals cannot be recovered. Your broken sharing link will become valid again.</p>
						<p><strong>3. Introducer and Referral/s of Commission Referral Program Members</strong><br>
						Every Commission Referral Program Member will have one introducer, except those who become Commission Referral Program Members by participating in Hookbag Sweepstakes Activities. Their introducer is Hookbag.<br>
						Every Commission Referral Program Member can develop your referrals network.<br>
						Introducer and referrals may change their positions: <br>
						When your introducer's Commission Referral Program Membership expires, the introducer of your original introducer will become your introducer.
						When your referral's Commission Referral Program Membership expires, your referral will become ordinary consumer user.
						</p>
						<p><strong>4. Commission Referral Program Rebate</strong><br>
						When a user A purchases CAD 1000 worth of product from Hookbag, A's introducer Commission Referral Program Member B will get a CAD 30 Commission Referral Program Activities bonus. B's introducer Commission Referral Program Member C will get a CAD 10 Commission Referral Program Activities bonus. C's introducer Commission Referral Program Member D will get a CAD 5 Commission Referral Program Activities bonus. D's introducer Commission Referral Program Member E will get a CAD 2.5 Commission Referral Program Activities bonus, and so on. When user A completes the payment for the CAD1000 spending, Commission Referral Program Activities bonuses will be transferred to the cash accounts of related Commission Referral Program Members, under the frozen status. If this order has no return within 45 days, then the Commission Referral Program Activities bonuses will become unfrozen and can be used by Commission Referral Program Members who get them. If this order has an Order Return within 45 days, then the frozen Commission Referral Program Activities bonuses will be canceled.
