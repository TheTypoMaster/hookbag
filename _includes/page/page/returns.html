You will have to mail the products directly to the manufacture for repair (if they provide such services) and assume the shipping costs generated during this process. Customers applying for return will receive our email notification and have two choices: to receive an equivalent replacement or to return for a full refund within 45 days of the delivery.

Products must be 100% complete with original manufacturer’s packaging and standard Product Serial Number or UPC Code (originally placed and not tampered with). All packing materials, contents and documentation must be included. Kits and other items assembled after purchase must be disassembled and returned in the manufacturer's original packaging. <strong>All returns will be inspected and those non-qualified and / or non-conforming returns will be subject to a 15% restocking fee*</strong> at Hookbag.ca's sole discretion.
        <br /><p>
        (Special / Custom / Heavy products are excluded, and cannot be returned). 
		<p><strong><em>3. Non-qualified Returns and Restocking Charges</em></strong><br />
		Non-qualified and non-conforming returns are not included in Hookbag.ca return policy and, if returned, will be rejected or subject to a 15% restocking fee at Hookbag.ca's sole discretion. This includes (but not limited to) items that are wrongly ordered, items the client no longer wants after order is placed,  or a product that the client ‘doesn’t like’ or is unsatisfied with. If the item is in proper working order and is NOT defective, the item will be considered non-qualifying and will be subject to rejection or a 15% restocking fee.
		</p>
		
		<p><strong><em>4. Defective, Wrong or Damaged Items</em></strong><br />
		Hookbag.ca takes full responsibility for defective items, wrong items shipped or items damaged during delivery. Customers can replace the item online by filling out the RMA form for replacement.

		<p><strong><em>5. Bundle Purchase</em></strong><br />
		Items sold as part of a bundle special may not be returned or replaced individually for that individual item. If you wish to return or replace a Bundle Special, you must return the entire bundle.   
		 </p>
		  
		  
		<p><strong><em>6. Open Box Items</em></strong><br />
		Hookbag.ca sells items that are listed as “open-box”. Such items are sold at greatly reduced prices and subject to a limited return policy. Open box items can only be returned for refund within 15 days of delivery. Hookbag.ca does not provide any replacement service for these items. As the items are sold at largely reduced price, the entire risk as to the quality and performance of these items is with the buyer. Although these items have been tested for functionality, they may have superficial physical defects including, but not limited to dings, dents or scratches. In case these items exhibit a functional defect after their purchase, the buyer (not the distributor, manufacturer, or Hookbag.ca) assumes the total cost of all necessary servicing or repairs, unless otherwise required by law. If you purchase a product at a largely reduced price, Hookbag.ca will only guarantee that you receive the product itself. Accessories may not be included with it. In that case, you need to buy the missing accessories by yourself.
