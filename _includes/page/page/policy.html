      <p><h5><strong>Environmental  Fees</strong></h5><br />
       The provinces of Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia have initiated recycling programs for computer products containing chemicals deemed hazardous to the environment. To fund this program these provinces require retailers and online sellers to collect on behalf of those provinces a fee for each product covered by the program. Customers pay this fee when they buy such a covered product. We will send this fee directly to the province. This only applies to orders shipped to addresses within Alberta, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia.<br />
       Products required to collect this recycling fee include CPUs, Printers, Monitors, Laptops, Servers and Televisions. The actual amount of the recycling fee will vary based on the product. Please review the charges below <br />
        <u>Alberta</u><br />
        <u>British Columbia</u> (effective as of August 1, 2007)<br />
        <u>Saskatchewan</u><br />
        <u>Ontario</u><br />
        To learn more about the scope and details of the recycling program, please refer to the provincial website at: Alberta<a href="http://www.albertarecycling.ca/" target="_blank">www.albertarecycling.ca</a>, British  Columbia<a href="http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/epdpa/ips/electronics/" target="_blank">www.env.gov.bc.ca/epd/epdpa/ips/electronics/</a>, Saskatchewan <a href="http://www.sweepit.ca/" target="_blank">www.sweepit.ca</a>. <br />

      <p><h5><strong>Pre-Authorization</strong></h5><br/>

      </p>
      
      <p><h5><strong>&quot;Must Be Purchased With Hardware&quot;</strong></h5><br />
        Software publishers often include a "Must Be Purchased With Hardware" condition of sale. In such cases, to purchase applicable software, Hookbag.ca’s customers must also buy some type of product under the general category of computer hardware. This includes any component that will be used when assembling a computer system. A hard drive, motherboard, processor or a floppy disk drive are such examples of merchandise that will qualify.

This includes but is not limited to color deviations, retail package alterations, new versions or revisions and other variations that manufacturers may consider inconsequential. Hookbag.ca depends on manufacturers to communicate these differences. At present we have no way of alerting customers prior to purchase in the event that a manufacturer fails to inform us about changes. Consequently, Hookbag.ca will not be held responsible for product revision changes.

     If any provision of this agreement is or becomes invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in whole or in part, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability shall not influence the remaining provisions and portions contained in this agreement, and the invalid, illegal, or unenforceable provision(s) shall be deemed modified so as to have the most similar result that is valid and enforceable under applicable Ontario law.
     <br/>
     
      <br/><h5><strong>Waiver</strong></h5><br />
      The failure of either party to require performance by the other party of any provision contained in this agreement shall not affect in any way the first party's right to require such performance at any time thereafter.
